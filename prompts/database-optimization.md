Review my database schema and ensure it includes:

Structure & Relationships:
- Proper table relationships with primary/foreign keys
- Normalized structure avoiding data duplication
- Junction tables for many-to-many relationships

Data Integrity:
- Unique constraints on emails, usernames, phone numbers
- NOT NULL requirements where appropriate
- Proper data types and validation rules

Performance & Maintenance:
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Migration planning for future schema changes
- Backup and recovery configuration

Explain the architectural decisions and suggest improvements.
