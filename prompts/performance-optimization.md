My application needs performance optimization. Here's my PageSpeed data:

[Include your specific PageSpeed results here]

Implement optimizations in this order:

1. Image Optimization
   - Compress large images (target ≤100KB where possible)
   - Implement lazy loading for off-screen images
   - Use modern formats like WebP where supported

2. Code Optimization
   - Remove unused JavaScript and CSS
   - Minify remaining files
   - Split large bundles into smaller chunks

3. Loading Improvements
   - Add loading states for async operations
   - Implement pagination for large data sets
   - Reduce layout shifts with proper sizing

For each optimization:
1. Identify the specific issue in my code
2. Show the updated implementation
3. Explain the performance benefit
4. Estimate the PageSpeed improvement

Work through these systematically, confirming each stage before proceeding.
